# Multi Step Form

This is a multi step form. I've used agile development method. Planning -> writing code -> testing -> deploying in small sprints is the practice that has been used in the development of this app.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure is build in such a way to keep the code organised. I've used atomic folder structure to get as many reusable components and make the codebase extensible.
